### **ABSTRACT**

This project consists of exposing the entire process of creating and developing an application, designed for smartphones and tablets, focused on communication between donors and adopters of domestic animals (pets), with the purpose of responsible adoption for these animals.

The idea was born from the mutual affinity of the members of this Project with the theme, also highlighting the current scenario of Brazilian cities, where there is, on the one hand, a strong culture of pet breeding, and on the other, the huge number of stray animals, abandoned or rescued after mistreatment, waiting in Public Centers or NGOs for a home.

The team investigate updated numbers of abandoned animals, rescued after mistreatment and/or occupants of NGOs or adoption houses. In addition, possible reasons for animal abandonment were researched, in order to understand and trace probable positive impacts in this context with the development of the application, and also, through a small sample at the university level, the public adherence to the pet adoption process, also verifying the reasons for not doing so.

The project presents the objectives and bases of the application; describes the important points for development; delimits the target audience and stakeholders; outlines the layout and the written and visual language, as well as the backend.

Finally, it is expected that the application represents a competent tool to unite responsible adopters, cozy homes and animals that need and deserve love, affection and care.
